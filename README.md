# Sales Performance and Growth Analysis

## Objective:

This dashboard analyses current sales performance vs. targets and prior year sales with YoY sales growth% and historical data from the last several years.


Performance and YoY growth% can be analysed by product, category, and month-wise timeline. There is a 1-year sales forecast using an exponential trendline and custom tooltips with graphs to show drill downs in the main page.
